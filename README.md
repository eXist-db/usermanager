# A template project for hybrid applications

## What's this?

This repo is meant to ease the creation of a hybrid project that is either consumable by bower and at the same time
allows to be packaged as a xar for deployment into eXistdb.

This kind of project is suited for hosting components (in a broad sense) for eXistdb. Many recurring functionel
components are made up of an UI part and a server-side part. This template project can be used as a starting
point to quickly create an application with all the needed config files and resources. 

See docs.md for details of setting up and using the toolchain.
